Nominal GDP is an assessment of economic production in an economy that includes current prices in its calculation. In other words, it doesn’t strip out inflation or the pace of rising prices, which can inflate the growth figure.
Nominal GDP is used when comparing different quarters of output within the same year. When comparing the GDP of two or more years, real GDP is used.

Specialty consumer goods are rare and often considered luxury purchases.

Unsought consumer goods are readily available but not often sought by the consumer. Life asurance

Fast-moving consumer goods include nondurable goods like food and drinks that move rapidly through the supply chain from producers to distributors and retailers to consumers. 

Capital goods, such as buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, and tools, are physical assets that a company uses in the production process to manufacture products and services that consumers will later use. 
Capital goods are not finished goods but are used to make finished goods. Consumer goods are those used by consumers and have no future productive use.


Due Date (invoice):
An invoice due date is when the seller expects the buyer to make the payment for goods sold or services provided. 
Mentioning the invoice due date is essential as it intimates the buyer about the maximum time he has to make the payment for his purchase. The seller could levy penalties or interest.

Revenue is the money generated from normal business operations, also known as sales on the income statement.
Accrual accounting will include sales made on credit as revenue for goods or services delivered to the customer.   et cash accounting  on the other hand, will only count sales as revenue when payment is received Ok deja vue

Revenue can be divided into operating revenue—sales from a company's core business—and non-operating revenue which is derived from secondary sources.
As these non-operating revenue sources are often unpredictable or nonrecurring, they can be referred to as one-time events or gains. 
For example, proceeds from the sale of an asset, a windfall from investments, or money awarded through litigation are non-operating revenue.

Income/profit usually incorporates other facets of a business. For example, net income or incorporate expenses such as cost of goods sold, operating expenses, taxes, and interest expenses.

Gross Profit Margin ( GPM)

This metric is useful for comparing a company's production efficiency over time. Simply comparing gross profits from year to year or quarter to quarter can be misleading, since gross profits can rise while gross margins fall

Gross profit is useful to determine how well a company is managing its production, labor costs, raw material sourcing, and spoilage due to manufacturing. Net income is useful to determine overall whether a company's enterprise-wide operation makes money when factoring in administrative costs, rent, insurance, and taxes
